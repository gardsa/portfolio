              <p>Melancholia - a feeling of deep sadness and gloomy forebodings. To achieve this mood in my project, I decided to film on an overcast day in an aesthetic but subdued location. The choice of environment was very important for this project, as invoking a feeling of sadness is enhanced by self-reflection. This requires a calm environment, where lots of contemplation can take place. The rocky shores of Red Rocks were perfect for achieving this. Adding to this feeling even more, the lack of vibrance and contrast caused by the weather resulted in a number of poignant clips. </p>
              <p>I decided to edit my footage in a montage style. My establishing shot is a mid shot of my actress staring out into the water. This lets the viewer know that the tone of this video will be sad, while also keeping an air of mystery surrounding the context of this sadness. From there, the next shot introduces the environment, which adds to the feeling of inner thoughts and melancholy. I then used a cut-in that mimics the establishing shot but is a close-up. By focusing on the expression of the actress, I aimed to reiterate the sense of pensive sadness. By then having my actress walk towards the ocean, it gives the idea of her slowly beginning to understanding why she feels this way. The following shot is a close-up of the actress standing by the water, revealing that sheâ€™s reached this place where she is more comfortable in her mood. From there, the next show depicts her slowly walking into the water, fully accepting her melancholy. The closing shot frames the environment then slowly pans to the sky. This shot leaves more to the viewers discretion, giving them a chance to explore their own inner melancholy, tying in to the overall theme of sadness and self-reflection.</p>
